# Clustering_Algorithms

In this machine learning project, we will build a model to authenticate banknotes as genuine or fake using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset consists of features extracted from images of banknotes, and we will use K-Means to cluster the data into two groups: genuine and fake banknotes
